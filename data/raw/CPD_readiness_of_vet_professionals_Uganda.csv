Enforcement gaps: Requiring CPD points from only a few individuals while leaving others out would be counterproductive.

Since the majority of veterinary practitioners work in the private sector, which is unregulated and difficult to oversee, enforcement is essential to ensure that everyone participates.

Getting time for CPD may be a big challenge for us however much we need it ; so there should be special consideration for such people.
2.Centralized CPD learning centres. We are just hearing CPD but we don't know where to go when and what it requires. So we are just confused. Let's decentralize CPD centres. Let's have regional/ subregional CPD centres to reduce on costs involved.
3.Let money not be the principal focus. We as vets have slot of money that we pay as annual UVB subscription fees , legal fees, certification fees and then plus CPD. Let CPD be affordable to all of us. Otherwise it might be a tool to kick out of practice those who can't afford to raise money for CPD.
4. Let CPD be done at least once in 3 years but not annually. It will mean all vets will be at school all the time as if we didn't study at all.CPD is building or adding on what we know.. Again it will be costly,and not affordable by all practitioners and so may lose meaning . This will also scare away some of us to abandon the profession.
